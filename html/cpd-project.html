                    <p><a href="https://www.surgeons.org/en" target="_blank">The Royal Australasian College of surgeons (RACS)</a> is a non-profit organisation that trains surgeons and maintains surgical standards in Australia and New Zealand.  The Continuing Professional Development (CPD) application helps surgeons manage their professional development activities and mandatory requirements required by the medical boards for continued registration.</p>

                    <ul class="disc-list">
                        <li>I analysed the existing CPD desktop application by</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>conducting <b>user interviews</b> (both internal and external) to understand what worked and what did not for the target audience</li>
                            <li>conducting <b>user surveys</b> to back the findings with quantitative data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>conducted competitor analysis</li>
                        <li>created <b>wireframes</b> and low-fidelity to high-fidelity <b>prototypes</b></li>

                <div class="project-problem">
                    <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                    <p>Surgeons are extremely time-poor and recording activities for professional development is not the most important task that they have to perform in the day, Though it is extremely important to record them to be able to practice surgery in Australia and New Zealand. Adding activities using the desktop application was time consuming and a desktop/laptop was not accessible all the time. The desktop application wasnâ€™t responsive.</p>

                    <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                    <p>The solution was designing and developing a mobile application that:</p>
                    <ul class="disc-list">
                        <li>could be accessed anywhere</li>
                        <li>was intuitive for the surgeons</li>
                        <li>enhanced user experience</li>
